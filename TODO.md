# ToDo
- Be able to write that message in the Client window

- Create a real session on the server side
    - Spawn another thread on a connection
    - Just keep waiting until it dies

- A plugin is an extension that an Admin can make for every user to use
    - Every plugin that wants to be used will need to be created and added first
- Be able to create new plugins using a base skeleton (different plugin types)
- Make a simple powershell plugin
    - This may be easy enough to abstract for any shell
- Make a file browser plugin
- Make a menu for all the available plugins
- Set permissions for who can use certain plugins
- Be able to have 2 of the same plugin with different settings
    - For example, the file browser
        - Admin should have read and write access
        - Users should only have read access
        - Or have Users with read and write but writes only in the Luxin Media space
- Create a plugin skeleton for each distinct kind of media
    - Be able to customize where and how it saves things
    - These plugins should be how you upload and download (or stream) the media
    - Videos
    - Music
    - Podcasts
    - Books (PDF)
    - Books (Epub)
    - Pictures
        - Be able to check if we already have the same picture on upload
- Each media file should have a hash of it
    - This way we can easily check if there's a new version for something
- The server and client should have the same decoding tools
    - This will make sure that the client will be able to use something that gets uploaded
- Make a disk space plugin
    - Show total disk space with used
    - Show used by the Luxin Media Server
    - Be able to discriminate further between each plugin (show a plugin usage breakdown)

- Create a login system
    - Admin should be the the only user with an empty password to start
    - This is for safety when using it outside of the local network
- Create a command line tool that can reset the Admin user's password
    - It would run locally so it must be run on the server after it's started up once
- The Admin should be the only one capable of creating other accounts
- Keep a cache of files on the local disk (client side)
    - These are ones downloaded from the server
    - Should be optional to download (or else just always streams)
        - Maybe a button close to the media
    - Always cache the file if it's been streamed to completion
        - This would mean to start writing the streaming file to disk
    - Some plugins may download the entire file first (PDF for example)
- Make a setting screen for client only settings
    - Anyone can set these if they're running a client
    - Cache life would be a good option
- Be able to use the client offline
    - This will just use the cached stuff
- Let the client open files on disk as if they were sent from the server
    - This would let the client be used generally, like VLC or something
- Keep track of progress for various media things if it supports it
    - This would be dependent on each plugin

- Be able to configure the server address from the client (from the UI)
    - This should be do-able without a config file that gets read in
    - It should remember the latest server connections
