# ToDo
- Start an encrypted session and make the hello world call
    - Both the client and server should generate their asymmetric keys
    - We don't really care about identity verification
- Create a login system
    - This is for safety when using it outside of the local network

- A plugin is an extension that an Admin can make for every user to use
    - Every plugin that wants to be used will need to be created and added first
- Be able to create new plugins using a base skeleton (different plugin types)
- Make a simple powershell plugin
    - This may be easy enough to abstract for any shell
- Make a file browser plugin
- Make a menu for all the available plugins
