# ToDo
- Create a login system
    - Admin should be the the only user with an empty password to start
    - This is for safety when using it outside of the local network

- A plugin is an extension that an Admin can make for every user to use
    - Every plugin that wants to be used will need to be created and added first
- Be able to create new plugins using a base skeleton (different plugin types)
- Make a simple powershell plugin
    - This may be easy enough to abstract for any shell
- Make a file browser plugin
- Make a menu for all the available plugins

- Create a command line tool that can reset the Admin user's password
